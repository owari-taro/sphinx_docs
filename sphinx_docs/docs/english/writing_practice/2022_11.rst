retired couple to have at least 20 million savings to enjoy retirement life.
showing  that how politicaly hard it is to rebuild public pension systems in Japan.

Once the report was appeared on the media, it attracted criticsm even from LDP members.
Although many acknwoledged the need to reform the pension system amid aging population.
But both politician and citizen don't to want to increase pension premium;
politicians ask further  and most of the workers 
don't afford more premium as japanese wage has been stagnant for decades. \

from one-child polich to three child policy
================================================
Chinese government announced it would allowed couples to have three kids from current two kids, earlier this week.
One child policy ,enated in 1980, ended up in  aging population and fewer workers.
Although ,in 2016, they abolished the policy and enabled coules to have at most two kids,
it was reveaeld insufficent to change aging demographinc trend.
In 2020 , NBS estimated that in about a quter of a centry, eledery will account for  one third-of china's population.


But For many middle class famileies, having three kids is unrealistic options,
becaulse they're striggling to find affordable housing,quality chid care facility,
taking care of both kids and their parents.
Even a weibo post claming that  one child is enough attracted many agreements from Chinese users .

Experts pointed out just rasing the number of kids coules can have isnt' enough.
