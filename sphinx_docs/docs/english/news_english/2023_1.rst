| Major Japanese telecom companies are to start using the networks of rival carriers in the case of disruptions. The aim is to maintain service for their customers.

| A communications outage in July for KDDI affected nearly 31 million subscribers.
| It disrupted corporate logistics systems and other services such as bank ATMs and public transport IC cards.

| KDDI will start later this month to allow companies and local governments to use the networks of NTT Docomo and SoftBank as a backup.
| KDDI's network will automatically switch to that of one of the rival firms when a disruption is detected.

| KDDI subscribers need to pay only for the data they use. 
| The company says the cost **would** be lower than **making a new contract** with a rival operator.

NTT Communications will also start a similar service this month

German prosecutors say they've **foiled a plot** by a terrorist group to try to overthrow their government.

| About 3,000 officers **raided** more than 130 locations in Germany, Austria, and Italy.
| They arrested 25 suspected members and supporters of a group of far-right and ex-military figures.

| Prosecutors say a man named Heinrich XIII and a former serviceman are believed to be **ringleaders**.
| They suspect some of the group's members planned to **storm the parliament building.**

| Members are said to **believe in a conspiracy theory **that Germany is controlled by a so-called deep state.
| And a plot to **install their own government** had been in the works since around November last year.

Prosecutors say the group had its own cabinet and **a military wing**, and was trying to recruit people in the German military and police.

People here in Japan are reflecting on what kind of year 2022 has been.
And many have chosen the kanji character meaning “war” or “battle” as the one best symbolizing the past 12 months.

Kanji are **the ideograms** used in written Japanese, adapted from Chinese characters.
A Kyoto-based association promoting the use of kanji **conducts the poll every year.**
It announced the result with a calligraphy performance at Kiyomizu Temple in the city.

Association officials say Russia's invasion of Ukraine **dealt a psychological blow** to many people, 
who are also **wrestling with** higher prices and the weaker yen.

The officials also cite Japan's fierce battles in international sports events, such as its victories over Germany and Spain in the men's FIFA World Cup group round.
